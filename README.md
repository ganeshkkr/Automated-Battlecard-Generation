The Automated Battlecard Generation System offers a variety of features designed to simplify the creation and customization of battlecards. It allows users to input company names and URLs, and the system generates battlecards based on the selected objective, such as sales or marketing comparisons. The battlecards compare key metrics like market share, product offerings, strengths, weaknesses, and competitive positioning between a company and its competitors. The system also enables the creation of detailed SWOT analysis for any company, offering insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Additionally, it incorporates web scraping functionality to gather data from the provided URLs, which enriches the generated battlecards by providing relevant, up-to-date content such as product descriptions and market strategies.

At the core of this system is the integration with Google Gemini AI, which processes input prompts and generates the battlecards or SWOT analysis based on the data provided. This AI-powered approach ensures accuracy and depth in the results. The system also provides an intuitive user interface built with Streamlit, where users can input their data and view the generated content. Once the battlecards are created, users can further customize them by editing the text within the app. To make the tool even more convenient, it offers the option to download the battlecards as individual files or all together in a text file.

The system also includes a feedback mechanism, allowing users to submit their feedback directly within the app. This feature helps improve the systemâ€™s functionality based on user experiences. These key features streamline the traditionally time-consuming process of generating battlecards and SWOT analyses, making the system efficient and user-friendly for business strategists, analysts, and marketing teams.
